# freeCodeCamp Greenville

*freeCodeCamp Greenville* is a group that meets once a week in Greenville South
Carolina to work on freeCodeCamp projects together. Students of any skill level
are welcome to attend.

We meet every Thursday at 7 PM at
[NEXT on Main](http://www.greenvillenext.com/next-space-locations/next-main/).

We're working on getting this website started. Please visit our
[Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.Greenville/) in
the meantime.
